# Hello world!

> It's not a cliché, it's a classic!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on @Confluence
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 👀 Enthusiast about: TDD, Clean Code, Agile...

## _Who is this guy?_

Well, it's nice to meet you too! I'm a developer who loves the ideal and strides to achieve it in every project.

## _What does he do?_

| Great | ObjectScript |
|:---:|:---:|
| Currently improving | Javascript, Typescript, Python, Flutter |
| Know the basics | C, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, React |

### _How did he learn all that? (aka my story)_

I learned to code through youtube videos when I was 12 using **_Python_**, then branched out to **_C_**, **_Java_**, **_HTML_** & **_CSS_** during my high school technical course.

Also during that time I fiddled with **_Javascript_** through the **_React_** library and learned **_PHP_** for some projects I had with a group of friends.

In my senior year I had to do a few mobile apps for school projects, and that's when I had the opportunity to learn **_React Native_** & **_Flutter_**.

<!--
Currently I work with ObjectScript & the IRIS Platform (used largely in hospitals and between systems integrations), and I have personal projects which allow me to use and improve in Typescript, Python & Flutter.

## **_So all he does is... coding?_**

Not at all! I play basketball 🏀 most weekends, love to play the piano 🎹 & the guitar 🎸, and watch silly comedy sitcoms and all kinds of movies 😊.
