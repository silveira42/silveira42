# 🤷 _What does he do?_
Currently I work with **_ObjectScript_** & the **_IRIS_** Platform, used largely in hospitals and between systems integrations.

Through that I have gained experience working with **_VTEX_**, **_SAP B1_** Service Layer, **_SAP B1_** Hana DB, **_OMS_**, **_Tasy_** and other **_ERPs_** and **_E-Commerces_**.

I also have a few personal projects which allow me to use and improve in **_Typescript_**, **_Python_** & **_Flutter_**.

<!--Known languages/technologies-->
## 🏆 _Here is my programming languages tier list_
| 🥇 | ObjectScript |
|:---:|:---:|
| 🥈 | Javascript, Typescript, Python, Flutter |
| 🥉 | C, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, React |

## 📖 _How did he learn all that? (aka my story)_
I learned to code through youtube videos when I was 12 using **_Python_**, then branched out to **_C_**, **_Java_**, **_HTML_** & **_CSS_** during my high school technical course.

Also during that time I fiddled with **_Javascript_** through the **_React_** library and learned **_PHP_** for some projects I had with a group of friends.

In my senior year I had to do a few mobile apps for school projects, and that's when I had the opportunity to learn **_React Native_** & **_Flutter_**.

<!--Other interests-->
# ⌨️ **_So all he does is... coding?_**
Not at all! I play basketball 🏀 most weekends, love to play the piano 🎹 & the guitar 🎸, and watch silly comedy sitcoms and all kinds of movies 😊.
