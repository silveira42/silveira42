# 🤷 _What does he do?_
Currently I work with ObjectScript & the IRIS Platform used largely in hospitals and between systems integrations.

Through that I have gained experience working with VTEX, SAP B1 Service Layer, SAP B1 Hana DB, OMS, Tasy and other ERPs and E-Commerces.

I also have a few personal projects which allow me to use and improve in Typescript, Python & Flutter.

## 📖 _How did he learn all that? (aka my story)_
I learned to code through youtube videos when I was 12 using **_Python_**, then branched out to **_C_**, **_Java_**, **_HTML_** & **_CSS_** during my high school technical course.

Also during that time I fiddled with **_Javascript_** through the **_React_** library and learned **_PHP_** for some projects I had with a group of friends.

In my senior year I had to do a few mobile apps for school projects, and that's when I had the opportunity to learn **_React Native_** & **_Flutter_**.

<!--Other interests-->
# ⌨️ **_So all he does is... coding?_**
Not at all! I play basketball 🏀 most weekends, love to play the piano 🎹 & the guitar 🎸, and watch silly comedy sitcoms and all kinds of movies 😊.
